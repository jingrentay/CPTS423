# Sprint 1 Report (2/2/23)

## What's New (User Facing)
We have added various features and components that have brought us closer to the desired web app.

* Accurate calculation of essential data - aggressive duration and predicted completion.
* Ability to move projects from in planning to in progress.
* Calculation of buffer time and time consumed to determine graph coordinates.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

For this sprint, we learned how to collect the correct data from the database needed for calculation purposes. The calculations are needed to create new data for plotting the graph coordinates based on the buffer time, duration, time consumed and project completion. We also had our first coding session where all 3 of us met up and coded together in the same environment. The result was very effective and it helped us to solve some difficult problems that we faced during implementation. In this sprint, we divided many tasks into smaller subtasks for each of us to complete and it resulted as a great way for solving difficulties and pushing our progress even faster. 

## Unfinished Work

The issues we worked on but did not finish include displaying the multi-fever chart plot points, task popup to view details, warnings, and moving the project to the archive when all the tasks are complete.

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:

* We did not get to this issue because we needed clarification from our client: https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/wsuetm-pmwebapp/issues/69.
* We ran into a complication and were not able to complete the issue for this sprint. It will be handled in the next sprint: https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/wsuetm-pmwebapp/issues/70.
* We prioritized other tasks instead of this one. It will be handled in the next sprint: https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/wsuetm-pmwebapp/issues/68.
* We ran into a complication and were not able to complete the issue for this sprint. It will be handled in the next sprint: https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/wsuetm-pmwebapp/issues/64.

## Retrospective Summary

Here's what went well:

* Progress of the project and client satisfaction 
* We had a good amount of meetings 
* Focus on smaller, more manageable tasks instead of bigger tasks

Here's what we'd like to improve:

* More progress every week
* Testing and figuring out unit test cases
* Schedule and completion of tasks

 Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
 
* Final preparation meeting Wednesday night for client meeting 
* More coding sessions where we brainstorm solutions together
* More frequent updates about where we are at in the task and expected timeline
