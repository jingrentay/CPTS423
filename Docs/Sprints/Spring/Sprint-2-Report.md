# Sprint 2 Report (3/2/23)

## What's New (User Facing)

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

## Unfinished Work

We have not yet completed the unique IDs for tasks, projects, and users. We also have not yet completed user authentication with tokens preventing unauthorized users from accessing information and pages if they are not authorized. The next step after this will be to allow users to create organizations and assign user roles. Users should only be able to access features they are authorized to use based on their role.

## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:

* We did not get to this issue because we focused on warnings, editing tasks, and login: https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/wsuetm-pmwebapp/issues/90
* We ran into an unexpected complication regarding authorization: https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/wsuetm-pmwebapp/issues/87
* We did not get to this issue because it will first require authentication and more research to implement: https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/wsuetm-pmwebapp/issues/88
