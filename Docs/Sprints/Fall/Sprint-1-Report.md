# Sprint 1 Report (8/22/22 - 10/9/22)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * A partial draft project report. 
 * The creation of a web app homepage with a title.
 * A basic graph showing the percentage of the project completed on the x-axis and the percentage of the buffer completed on the y-axis. 

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, the Vizualizers completed all assigned report sections. On September 21st, we turned in our “Project Description” section. On September 28th, we turned in our “Requirements and Specifications” section and on October 6th, we turned in our “Solution Approach” section. In order to create the skeleton code for our web app, we learned about all the tools we need to use, including React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for our MERN stack. Since most of us are new to web apps, it was required that we research and learn about these services and tools. We learned how to create and run a basic web app and created a blank title page for our website. We set up our database in MongoDB and connected it to our web app. Lastly, we researched Chart.js so that we could add a chart to our UI.

## Unfinished Work
Although we have filled out most of our README.md file, this file will be updated throughout the course of the project. Our installation and functionality sections will most likely change. We have not updated the license section yet because we need to meet with our client and determine the best course of action regarding a public or private repository and which license to use. We have completed all other issues we planned for this sprint.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * The team was able to meet, understand our teammates’ capabilities, and work  together to improve shortcomings.
  * We submitted most of the assignments and documents on time during Sprint 1.
  * We met with the client weekly. We were able to communicate our work capacity with the client effectively and make progress toward his vision.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
  * We’d like to improve our utilization of GitHub for tracking our project.
  * We are currently working towards making the interface more user friendly.
  * We can improve our communication with our client, keep him updated with what we are working on, and demo our app in meetings if there is something new.
 
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
  * We will improve our use of milestones, issues, and story points to track our project. We will create issues for features and assign them to team members, as well as keep track of story points.
  * We would want our UI to be more responsive and well integrated with the database.
  * We would like to finish most of the basic features required by the client and possibly finish some of the advanced features for VPM application.
