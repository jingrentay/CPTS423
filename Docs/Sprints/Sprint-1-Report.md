# Sprint 1 Report (8/22/22 - 10/9/22)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * A partial draft project report. 
 * The creation of a web app homepage with a title.
 * A basic graph showing the percentage of the project completed on the x-axis and the percentage of the buffer completed on the y-axis. 

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, the Vizualizers completed all assigned report sections. On September 21st, we turned in our “Project Description” section. On September 28th, we turned in our “Requirements and Specifications” section and on October 6th, we turned in our “Solution Approach” section. In order to create the skeleton code for our web app, we learned about all the tools we need to use, including React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for our MERN stack. Since most of us are new to web apps, it was required that we research and learn about these services and tools. We learned how to create and run a basic web app and created a blank title page for our website. We set up our database in MongoDB and connected it to our web app. Lastly, we researched Chart.js so that we could add a chart to our UI.
