# Visual Project Management Web Application

## Project Summary

A web application that allows users to create and manage projects more efficiently according to the theory of Virtual Project Management. 

### Additional information about the project

Visual Project Management allows users to track the progress of one or multiple of their projects using the VPM method. They can create and add tasks to a project, as well as add an aggressive estimate for each task. The system calculates a buffer for the project and uses these estimates to plot the last known "Completed Task" on a Fever Chart. This helps users view whether their project is very late (black zone), falling behind (red zone), or on track (green zone). Users can also create organizations and roles to help organize who contributes to a project, along with many more features.
